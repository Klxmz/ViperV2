 This file temporarily removes the Process " LanSchoolAir " your laptop/chromebook/desktop.
 
 Therefore blocking teachers from accessing your device.

For those who don't know what LanSchool/LanSchoolAir is, it's the program teachers use to view and access your school laptop and desktop.

<why> - me personally, I like to browse n watch movies or play games after I finish my work or if I just want to but teachers like to block my screen.
<how> - Command Prompt is an very powerful tool when you know how to use it this here is just a simple " taskkill command on repeat.
